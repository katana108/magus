## 1. Introduction (1.5-2 pages)

### 1.1 Motivation
- AGI systems need motivational architectures beyond reward maximization

   - Coherence: Boost mutually supporting goals
   - Efficiency: Penalize resource-heavy goals
   - Learning: Promote novel/unexplored goals
   - Uncertainty Reduction: Prioritize high-uncertainty targets
   - **Connected to M2 metrics** (novelty uses measurability)

3. **Ethical Anti-Goal Framework** (M3)
   - Hard constraints (veto unsafe actions)
   - Soft constraints (penalty-based)
   - Data-driven costs (energy, risk, distance from knowledge bases)

## 3. Methodology: MAGUS Architecture (3-4 pages)

### 3.1 System Overview
- Three-tier architecture: M2 (Metrics) → M3 (Metagoals/Anti-goals) → M4 (Validation)
- Data flow diagram

### 3.2 Milestone 2: Goal Fitness Metrics
#### 3.2.1 Measurability
- **Formula**: `Measurability = Confidence × Clarity`
- **Confidence**: How certain we are about goal state
- **Clarity**: How well-defined the goal measurement is
- **Example values**:
  - Energy: 0.72 (high - objective, well-understood)
  - Exploration: 0.56 (moderate)
  - Affinity: 0.20 (low - subjective, hard to measure)

#### 3.2.2 Correlation
- **Method**: Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC)
- Captures linear and non-linear relationships
- **Example values**:
  - Energy ↔ Exploration: 0.70 (strong positive)
  - Energy ↔ Affinity: 0.50 (moderate)
  - Exploration ↔ Affinity: 0.30 (weak)

#### 3.2.3 Validation
- 19/19 tests passing
- Reference implementation with target values
- Approximate equality testing (floating-point tolerance)

### 3.3 Milestone 3: Strategic Decision-Making
#### 3.3.1 Metagoal System
- **Coherence**: Boost goals with high correlation (>0.5 threshold)
  - Uses M2 correlation data
- **Efficiency**: Penalize resource-heavy goals
  - Cost estimation from context
- **Learning**: Promote novel goals
  - **Uses M2 measurability**: `novelty = (1 - measurability) × 0.4`
  - Low measurability → novel → worth exploring
- **Uncertainty Reduction**: Boost high-uncertainty goals
  - **Uses M2 measurability**: Threshold-based (<0.3 triggers boost)

#### 3.3.2 Anti-Goal System
- **Hard Constraints** (veto): Unsafe actions → score = 0
- **Soft Constraints** (penalty): Suboptimal actions → score reduction
- **Data-Driven Costs**:
  - Energy costs from knowledge base
  - Risk penalties from context
  - Distance costs (spatial/temporal)

#### 3.3.3 Scoring v2 Pipeline
```
BaseUtility = Σ(considerations) - Σ(discouragements)
MetagoalAdjustment = Σ(metagoal_adjustments)
AntiGoalPenalty = Σ(antigoal_penalties)
FinalScore = (BaseUtility + MetagoalAdjustment) × (1 - AntiGoalPenalty)
```

- **Transparency**: Decision breakdown with component scores
- **Auditability**: Logging at each stage

#### 3.3.4 Integration Validation
- M2 metrics successfully feed M3 metagoals
- No placeholder constants in production code
- Type signature coverage: 73% M3, 81% M4

### 3.4 Milestone 4: Ethical Evaluation
#### 3.4.1 Scenario Catalog (10 canonical cases)
1. **Resource Allocation Fairness**: Distribute limited resources
2. **Privacy vs. Security**: Balance competing values
3. **Autonomy Preservation**: Respect user agency
4. **Deception Prohibition**: Honesty as anti-goal
5. **Harm Prevention**: Safety-critical scenarios
6. **Fairness in Decision-Making**: Unbiased treatment
7. **Transparency Requirements**: Explainable decisions
8. **Consistency and Alignment**: Goal stability
9. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Context-aware ethics
10. **Long-Term Consequences**: Temporal discounting

#### 3.4.2 Validation Pipeline
- Scenario schema: context, candidates, expected outcomes
- Scenario runner: applies metagoals and anti-goals
- Ethical logging: decision traces with justifications
- Metrics collection: aggregates results across scenarios

#### 3.4.3 Ablation Studies
- Disable metagoals: Measure impact on strategic decisions
- Disable anti-goals: Measure impact on ethical boundaries
- Disable M2 metrics: Measure data-driven vs. fixed values

### 3.5 Implementation Details
- **Language**: MeTTa (Hyperon 0.2.1)
- **Best Practices**:
  - No inline lambdas (named functions with type signatures)
  - Equality-based dispatch (avoid let/match pattern)
  - No atomspace mutation in lambdas
  - Knowledge bases for persistent data, not volatile state
- **Testing**: 24/24 Python tests passing (100%)

## 5. Discussion and Lessons Learned (1.5 pages)

### 5.1 Key Insights

#### 5.1.1 Data-Driven Metrics Work
- M2 measurability successfully distinguishes objective/subjective goals
- M2 correlation captures goal relationships
- **Lesson**: Quantitative metrics can complement symbolic reasoning

#### 5.1.2 Integration Requires Discipline
- Connecting M2 → M3 required replacing all placeholder constants
- **Lesson**: Test data flow end-to-end, don't assume integration

#### 5.1.3 Best Practices Matter
- Top 5 anti-patterns caused most bugs:
  1. Inline lambdas (15+ violations)
  2. let/match pattern (6 bugs)
  3. Atomspace mutation in lambdas (hard to detect)
  4. Missing type signatures (reduced clarity)
  5. Placeholder constants (data not flowing)
- **Lesson**: Language-specific best practices critical for success

#### 5.1.4 Test-Driven Development Essential
- Early M2/M3 work claimed success without execution
- Discovered broken code only when user requested actual tests
- **Lesson**: Never document success before test execution

#### 5.1.5 Symbolic AGI Tradeoffs
- **Pros**:
  - Transparent reasoning (can inspect every step)
  - Auditable decisions (logged traces)
  - Type safety (catch errors early)
- **Cons**:
  - Performance overhead vs. neural approaches
  - Language-specific quirks (Hyperon evaluation issues)
  - Steeper learning curve

### 5.2 Threats to Validity

#### 5.2.1 Limited Scenario Coverage
- 10 canonical scenarios not exhaustive
- Real-world ethics more nuanced
- **Mitigation**: Scenarios designed to cover major categories

#### 5.2.2 Synthetic Evaluation
- No real agents, no real-world deployment
- Stubs for AIRIS/HERMES integration
- **Mitigation**: Focused on architecture validation, not production deployment

#### 5.2.3 Hyperon 0.2.1 Limitations
- Some evaluation issues with complex patterns
- Metrics retrieval workaround needed
- **Mitigation**: All functionality works, display issues only

#### 5.2.4 Single Implementation Language
- Only tested in MeTTa, not other symbolic systems
- **Future Work**: Port to other AGI frameworks for comparison

### 5.3 Generalizability
- Principles apply to other symbolic AGI frameworks
- M2 metrics framework language-agnostic
- Metagoal/anti-goal pattern reusable
- **Claim**: Architecture generalizes beyond MeTTa

### 5.4 Ethical Considerations
- MAGUS is a research prototype, not production system
- Anti-goals based on researcher assumptions, not democratic consensus
- **Limitation**: Whose values are encoded?
- **Future Work**: Value learning, participatory design
