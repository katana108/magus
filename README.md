# MAGUS - Modular Adaptive Goal and Utility System

**Experimental MeTTa implementation of goal-driven decision making for AGI systems**

## Project Status: ✅ M2/M3/M4 Complete (October 2025)

All milestones implemented and validated:
- **M2**: Goal Fitness Metrics (Measurability, Correlation) - 19/19 tests passing
- **M3**: Metagoals, Anti-goals, Scoring v2, Planner - Fully integrated with M2
- **M4**: Ethical Evaluation Framework - 5/5 pipeline tests passing

**Total: 24/24 Python tests passing (100%)** | **Validated in WSL Ubuntu environment**

## Overview

MAGUS is a modular goal and utility system implementing:
- **Goal Fitness Metrics** - Measurability and correlation tracking for goal evaluation
- **Metagoals** - Strategic value adjustments (coherence, exploration, safety)
- **Anti-goals** - Constraint enforcement with penalties
- **Ethical Framework** - Scenario validation with ethical logging
- **Scoring v2** - Integrated pipeline with modulators and overgoal

Built in MeTTa language (Hyperon 0.2.1) with comprehensive test coverage.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with MeTTa/Hyperon installed
- **WSL Ubuntu environment required on Windows** - Hyperon 0.2.1 uses Linux binaries

### Installation
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install hyperon
```

### Initialization (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ Critical**: All MAGUS code requires grounded Python math functions:

```python
from hyperon import MeTTa
from magus_init import initialize_magus

metta = MeTTa()
initialize_magus(metta)  # Registers sqrt, pow, abs, floor, ceil, sin, cos, log, exp

# Now load MAGUS modules
metta.run("!(import! &self Milestone_3/core/scoring-v2.metta)")
```

**Why**: Geometric mean calculations require `sqrt` and `pow`. Without initialization, math operations fail with "unbound symbol" errors.

### Running Tests

**All tests must run in WSL on Windows**:

```bash
# Quick run
wsl bash run_all_tests_wsl.sh

# Or individually in WSL:
cd /mnt/e/GitLab/the-smithy1/magi/neoterics/metta-magus
source .venv/bin/activate

python Milestone_2/goal-fitness-metrics/measurability/test_measurability.py  # 12 tests
python Milestone_2/goal-fitness-metrics/correlation/test_correlations.py     # 7 tests
python Milestone_4/tests/test_m4_pipeline.py                                  # 5 tests

# Expected: 24/24 tests passing
```

```
M2 Metrics (Measurability, Correlation)
         ↓
M3 Metagoals (Strategic Adjustments)
         ↓
M3 Overgoal (Goal Set Coherence)

### Core Types

**Goal**: `(goal name priority weight)` - Basic goal structure
**Metagoal**: `(metagoal type)` - Strategic value adjustments
**AntiGoal**: `(anti-goal name severity penalty-fn)` - Constraints
**Candidate**: `(goal-candidate goal)` or `(action-candidate action)`
**DecisionScore**: `(decision-score base meta anti final)` - Score breakdown

### Key Modules

**M2:**
- `Milestone_2/goal-fitness-metrics/measurability/` - Measurability calculations
- `Milestone_2/goal-fitness-metrics/correlation/` - MIC correlation

**M3:**
- `Milestone_3/core/metagoals.metta` - Metagoal system (connected to M2)
- `Milestone_3/core/antigoals.metta` - Anti-goal constraints
- `Milestone_3/core/overgoal.metta` - Overgoal calculation
- `Milestone_3/core/scoring-v2.metta` - Integrated scoring pipeline

**M4:**
- `Milestone_4/scenarios/scenario-runner.metta` - Scenario execution
- `Milestone_4/ablations/ablation-runner.metta` - Ablation framework
- `Milestone_4/integration/` - AIRIS/HERMES integration patterns

## Code Quality

**Best Practices Compliance**:
- ✅ No inline lambdas (use named functions)
- ✅ No `let` with `match` (use equality-based dispatch)
- ✅ No atomspace mutation in lambdas
- ✅ Type signatures for all functions
- ✅ Data-driven (M2 metrics connected to M3 metagoals)

**Test Coverage**: 24/24 Python tests (100% pass rate)
- M2 Measurability: 12/12
- M2 Correlation: 7/7
- M4 Pipeline: 5/5

**Performance**: Within 25% regression budget

---

## Known Limitations

- **Hyperon 0.2.1**: Some evaluation issues with complex patterns
  - Workaround: Equality-based dispatch, Python tests
- **M3 estimate-cost**: Placeholder returns 0.0
  - Impact: Low - cost estimation not critical for milestone validation
- **M4 Integration**: AIRIS/HERMES use mock implementations
  - Impact: Low - demonstrates integration patterns

See milestone summaries for detailed limitations and workarounds.
