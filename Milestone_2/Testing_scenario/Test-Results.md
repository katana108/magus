## 6. Known Issues and Limitations

### 6.1 Resolved Issues
- ✅ Floating-point precision in measurability calculations (resolved via 0.01 tolerance)
- ✅ MIC calculation performance (simplified for 3-bin case)

### 6.2 Current Limitations

**L1: Static Confidence Values**
- **Issue:** Confidence scores are hardcoded per goal type
- **Impact:** Low (acceptable for M2 prototype)
- **Future Work:** Implement adaptive confidence in M3+

**L2: Fixed 3-Bin MIC**
- **Issue:** Bin count not optimized per dataset
- **Impact:** Low (sufficient for current data volumes)
- **Future Work:** Dynamic bin optimization in M4

**L3: Limited Goal Set**
- **Issue:** Only 3 test goals (Energy, Exploration, Affinity)
- **Impact:** Medium (need broader validation)
- **Future Work:** Expand test suite with 10+ goals
