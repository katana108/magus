Can I drink for an audio check?

Sure and you got hurt. Thanks so much, Matthew, yeah, I'm just kind of made maybe waiting one more minute and then start unless, well, I mean, any questions or issues that anybody has would like to talk about today. I

a few More people just joined.

Maybe I'll ask if, whether, since nobody responded to my first question, I'll just repeat it, any questions or issues that people are encountering or wish to know more about, say here and

Charlie, you often have questions.

Sorry, I haven't been paying nearly enough attention to MeTTa to have any questions on MeTTa today. Sorry, okay. I

Not a question. But I was just going to recommend that if people are getting into it and trying to do some vibe coding, cloud code has been amazing. It's actually able to handle better. This first one I found that was able to do that

just the sonnet four,

yeah. And if you set it up, particularly with the clock code interface, where it can see your files and directory, it's pretty good.

I That's interesting. I'm

nil always has something interesting, but he's not here today. I'm

anything you've encountered Colleen or Robert and she sometimes,

no, I'm just here paying attention today, that's about it.

Well, let's hope that there's something to pay attention to, right?

Right? Me too, I'm hoping. No, I

uh, Lake. Did you ever get that? If you sort it out from a month and a half ago, whatever it was,

yeah, so there was an update that was required. I'm pretty sure that updates been pushed, but the general recommendation was just to move to constyle lists, not to use iterative lists. So, yeah, it was. The issue was that I was trying to do a non trivial like functor as the filter for the filter function, and you couldn't do that at the time, but they've since changed that, and it should work. Cool.

I'll be back.

You know, I did have one question, though, Matt. I was just listening to the talks at proof of talk that Ben and the CEO of fetch did, and they had mentioned a new research project called quello. Does anyone have information on that?

So

well Oh is

how to describe. Well, yeah, there's so that's a product that's actually been put together, and it's kind of a foundation of several projects that we're working on, involving it's i this kind of, this idea based on, I might be getting several of these mixed up, because there's fellow quest store and then the True AGI researcher product, but they're starting off as kind of a A something from similar to

researcher product, and I'm just trying to refresh my my memory here. And so the idea is,

I have notes on exactly exactly that, but there's somewhere back.

So there's different versions of this, and it's similar to Google research or and connecting to not llms with Knowledge graphs for kind of doing some deep research. And

and I have the full

description, that's okay, and that's okay. It's all right.

Got dropped there.

I can probably get you fuller information here.

So it's so right? It's a deep research assistant to transform document analysis using knowledge graphs coupled with large language models.

So we have a number of demo cases in development, and this is based on some earlier ideas that we had considered, but one of them is like healthcare literature Explorer. So it's going to accelerate synthesis of clinical evidence from different research papers. We have different domains. We also have this for the finance domain. I don't know is that I could go into more detail, but that's the broad overview.

Yeah, that's helpful. That's helpful. I'd be able to get through it through the demo cases, correct or at least find out more

through the demo cases. So, so it's, I'm not sure when it's scheduled for release. So the first version quello will be open source. And so the idea is it can ingest a bunch of papers, PDFs, and then turn those into interactive and searchable knowledge graphs. Okay, and apply different systems to those knowledge graph. So in the beginning it'll be, you know, basically using L lens. But as this gets further iterated, we'll start including additional AI systems for reasoning, for example, into the within quello.

Okay, and we're looking at, I mean, the first couple of use cases are in the health domain, and then there's also a version being developed for finance and defi. Okay.

Thank you so much. I appreciate the information. I

not MeTTa, coder directly

related, but, yeah,

uh, anything else? Any updates you would like to share with people? Alexey, well, I just not for my sake, okay, well nil, just joined.

Yeah, yeah. So I, my, I have an issue, and it has to do with the more or minimum meta two, and I'm just trying to, well, I did manage to compile it, and then I'm not sure what to do with it. And well, the Read Me is not very it's not very clear in terms of what you're supposed to do with it. And so I has made more problems interested.

What that sounds like a question for Adam, who can't make it today, yeah, and he Yeah, he's not

here. But if anybody has has managed to, well, to run something, then, well, I'd be interested.

Well, I mean, without, I think that's the question everyone's wait waiting for, right with, mm two, or the answer to that question, which is, How do you use it? And that is Adam I

and I don't know anyone else has played with it at all or not.

You met with Adam, and I think you know more than anybody else here about that nil,

right? Yeah, yeah, because I on madam boss, it looks like some people at least, were trying. So I was hoping that someone could help here. But apparently that is not the case regarding other issues might have a look at maybe I have some some issues in the background, if you I'll just open that up and see if I find something. In the meantime, anybody has any issue or anything to Share, please feel free to Go ahead of course I'm

I cannot find anything. I don't have any me pending issues regarding my term.

Well, in that case, since it doesn't seem like there's any questions, updates, issues, I don't think it makes sense to waste people's time, so give you back 40 minutes. All right, thanks guys, and hopefully we'll have information on mm two for next time minimal MeTTa two.

All right,

okay, have a great weekend. Bye.

Great weekend. All Bye. You
